Hi, professor Stratos,

I have come back to China last week beacuse I was scratched by the cat and need to get the rabies vaccine as soon as possible(it's expensive in American).
And I am working with kostas through the skype these days.
You know, kostas will not be in the lab until April and life in American costs a lot of money, so could I work with kostas in China for the last 2 months?
Also, the seat could be arranged to other person who work in our lab.

Best wishes!
Mo
